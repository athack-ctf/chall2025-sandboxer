# How to Solve the Challenge?

This game tasks the player to reach an enemy whose internal name is “ningen”. This enemy continuously spawns other enemies that attack the player from afar. This game stores its level configurations using files in its internal directories. These configuration files allow the user to edit the level directly. One edit can place “ningen” over an edge such that all its minions fall. This arrangement of enemies can reveal the flag, as the former displays it. The minions are responsible for obscuring it.
